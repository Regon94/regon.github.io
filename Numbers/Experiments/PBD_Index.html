            <h1>The Pale Blue Dot Index</h1>
            <p>
               The pale blue dot index aims to capture efficiency in global GDP growth. It does so by broadening the
               definition of "growth". At the moment when we hear about global growth or national growth the measure 
               includes only economic growth. This index aims to include more factors, what is the diversity of flora
               and fauna in the country, how many eco-systems has it kept alive, how many new eco systems does it have 
               access to?(space and sea).
